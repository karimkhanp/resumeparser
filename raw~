We present an evaluation of the effectiveness of detecting events using a variety of features derived from Twitter posts, namely temporal, spatial, and textual content.

We evaluate our framework on a large-scale, real-world dataset from Twitter.
Furthermore, we apply our event detection system to a large corpus of tweets posted during the August
2011 riots in England. We use ground-truth data based on intelligence gathered by the London Metropolitan
Police Service, which provides a record of actual terrestrial events and incidents during the riots, and show
that our system can perform as well as terrestrial sources, and even better in some cases.

many existing approaches to event detection are limited to global or large-scale event detection (e.g., natural disasters and terror at-tacks), while detecting small-scale incidents such as fires, car accidents, and public
order events remains an ongoing research topic due to several key challenges.

Major challenges -
One challenge is that online posts are often constrained in length (referred to as
microblogs), which means that only a small amount of text is available to be analysed
to gain insights. 

Frequent use of informal, irregular, and abbreviated words; 
A large number of spelling and grammat-ical errors;
The use of improper sentence structure and mixed languages 
Mixed language - Some languages are more challenging than others, for example, Arabic users use dialects heavily as well as a mixture of Latin and Arabic characters (Arabizi) 
Different patterns of dialects in vocabulary, morphology, and spelling from the standard language ( here Arabic), and most do not have standard spellings. 
Spammers - social networking services popularity have attracted spammers and other content polluters to spread advertisements, pornography, viruses, phishing, and other malicious material that cloud the information analysis
